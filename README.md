#### Advanced Options (disable "Use recommended settings")
- **Model**: `glm-4.7` (only supported model)
- **Maximum Tokens**: Max response length (1-8000, default: 3000)
- **Temperature**: Response randomness (0-1, default: 1.0)

## Usage

### In Home Assistant Assist

1. Open Home Assistant's Voice Assistant
2. Select your z.ai conversation agent from the dropdown

### Controlling Devices

When "Control Home Assistant" is enabled, you can control your devices naturally:

```
"Turn on the living room lights"
"Set the thermostat to 72 degrees"
"What's the temperature in the bedroom?"
```

### Custom Prompts

You can customize the system prompt to change the agent's behavior:

```yaml
You are a helpful assistant for home automation.
Be concise and friendly. When controlling devices,
confirm the action after completing it.
```

## Supported Models

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| glm-4.7 | Supported model | General use |

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect" error

- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the base URL is correct
- Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages

### "Authentication error"

- Your API key may be invalid or expired
- Generate a new API key from z.ai
- Reconfigure the integration with the new key

### Agent not responding

- Check Home Assistant logs for errors
- Verify the conversation agent is enabled
- Try adjusting max tokens or temperature settings
- Ensure z.ai service is operational

### Tool calling not working
